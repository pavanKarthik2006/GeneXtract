üß¨ GeneXtract ‚Äì Gene/Protein-Focused Biomedical NER

GeneXtract is a transformer-based Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) system fine-tuned on gene and protein annotation datasets. Built on top of BioBERT, GeneXtract is optimized for extracting gene- and protein-level biological entities from scientific literature, enabling structured downstream analysis for computational biology and bioinformatics research.

‚úÖ What GeneXtract Does

Identifies gene and protein mentions in biomedical text

Uses a fine-tuned BioBERT model for high-accuracy entity tagging

Supports preprocessing and token-level annotation for custom datasets

Enables entity normalization to standardized biomedical vocabularies

Designed as a foundation for pathway reconstruction and molecular-level reasoning

üîç Why GeneXtract?

Biomedical research papers contain dense molecular information that is difficult to manually scan and curate. GeneXtract automates the discovery of gene/protein entities, helping accelerate:

Molecular interaction mining

Pathway enrichment

Gene-disease association studies

Drug discovery pipelines

üöÄ Tech Stack

Python / PyTorch

HuggingFace Transformers

BioBERT

JNLPBA-style gene/protein datasets
